# Generative AI Tools

This directory contains independent, runnable Generative AI tools and experiments. Each tool is self-contained in its own folder under `tools/`.

## Structure

- `tools/<tool_name>/` â€” Each folder contains a runnable Streamlit app and documentation for a specific Generative AI use case.

## How to Add a New Tool

1. Create a new folder under `tools/`.
2. Add your code (e.g., `streamlit_app.py`) and a `README.md` describing the tool.
3. List dependencies in the top-level `requirements.txt` if needed.
