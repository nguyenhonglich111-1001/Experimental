# Always Use Streamlit as Backbone for Scripts

## Critical Rules

- All new Python scripts or UI applications must use Streamlit as the primary framework for user interfaces and app backbones
- Do not use other UI frameworks (e.g., Flask, FastAPI, Tkinter, PyQt) for main app logic or user interaction layers
- If a script requires a UI, it must be implemented with Streamlit
- When refactoring or updating existing UI scripts, migrate them to Streamlit if feasible
- Only use other frameworks for backend APIs or non-UI logic, not for the main user-facing app

## Examples

<example>
  Creating a dashboard: Use Streamlit to build the dashboard UI and handle user input/output
  Refactoring a CLI tool to have a UI: Implement the UI with Streamlit
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  Building a new Python app with Flask for the main user interface
  Using Tkinter for a desktop UI instead of Streamlit
  Adding a FastAPI endpoint for direct user interaction instead of a Streamlit page
</example>
