# Rule: Always Create .env_example

## Description
Ensures that a `.env_example` file is always created in the root of each project. This file should contain placeholder values for all environment variables used in the project, serving as a template for developers to set up their local environment.

## Trigger
This rule is always active.

## Action
When a new project is initialized or when environment variables are identified, ensure a `.env_example` file is present and up-to-date with all required environment variables.

## Example `.env_example`
```
# Example .env_example file
# This file lists all environment variables required for the project.
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values.

DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
VOYAGE_API_KEY="your_voyage_api_key"
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

## Configuration
```json
{
  "alwaysApply": true,
  "description": "",
  "glob": ""
}
```
