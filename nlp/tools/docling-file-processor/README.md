## Features

*   **File Upload:** Supports PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG, JPEG file uploads.
*   **Docling Integration:** Utilizes the Docling library for robust document parsing.
*   **OCR Capability:** Integrates EasyOCR for text recognition in images and scanned PDFs.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd nlp/tools/docling-file-processor
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```

    ```

    The application will open in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your web browser.
2.  Use the "Choose a file" button to upload a document.
3.  Click "Process Document" to initiate Docling processing.
4.  View the extracted text in the "Extracted Text" section.

## Notes

*   For OCR functionality, `easyocr` will download necessary models on first run. This might take some time.
*   Ensure you have the necessary system dependencies for `easyocr` if you encounter issues (e.g., `Pillow`, `opencv-python`).
*   Uploaded files are temporarily stored in the `uploads/` directory and are removed after processing.
