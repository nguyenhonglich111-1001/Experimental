Amnesty International's annual report on the death penalty states that many governments are using capital punishment in a futile attempt to tackle threats to state security and public safety [source_2].

    "generated_answer": "The objective of the negotiations was not the total elimination of Iran's nuclear program, but rather to structure an agreement that would prevent Iran from covertly developing a nuclear arsenal before allies could respond [source_1]. The new framework aims to reduce Iran's low-enriched uranium stockpile, decrease its number of installed centrifuges by two-thirds, and implement a rigorous inspection regime [source_1]. A dubious assumption is that Iran's nuclear program is a covert weapons program [source_1].\n\nHarsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices were instrumental in bringing Iran to the negotiating table, as Iran had the most to lose from a failed negotiation [source_2]. However, political considerations made the United States the supplicant [source_2]. The framework agreement begins lifting sanctions too soon, allowing nuclear enrichment to continue at a lower level [source_2]. Iran will officially become a nuclear threshold state with a \"breakout\" period of one year, during which inspectors would supposedly discover violations and allow the world to act [source_2]. The Fordow facility will remain, converted to a nuclear \"research facility\" without nuclear material on site, and international sanctions will begin to lift almost immediately [source_2]. Iran's nuclear infrastructure will largely remain in place, even if operating at a reduced capacity [source_2].\n\nThe talks were between Iran and the P5+1 countries (United States, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Germany), not solely between the United States and Iran [source_3]. If Congress rejects the P5+1 agreement, it could lead to the unraveling of sanctions on Iran and threaten NATO cohesion [source_3]. The agreement does not contain a sunset clause that would allow Iran to do as it pleases afterwards; some restrictions on uranium enrichment will be eased or eliminated over time, up to 15 years, but most importantly, the framework agreement includes Iran's ratification of the [source_3].\n\nThe U.S.-imposed March 31 deadline for the framework agreement announcement was a bad tactic that pressured the United States and was publicly decried by the French ambassador [source_4]. This was a political move to produce a result, however vague, to protect the talks from critics [source_4]. While an agreement ensuring Iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be welcome, the current agreement does not look promising and differs from President Obama's earlier vow to accept a deal where Iran ends its nuclear program [source_4]. Nobody is talking about Iran ending its nuclear program; Iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its over 6,000 [source_4].",
