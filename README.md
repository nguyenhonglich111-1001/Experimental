# Experimental AI Lab

A personal collection of runnable AI tools and experiments, focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and supporting technologies. Each tool is self-contained, runnable (usually via Streamlit), and organized by theme for easy extension and reuse.

- To run a tool, navigate to its folder and use Streamlit or the provided instructions.
- See `memory-bank/` for project context and documentation.
