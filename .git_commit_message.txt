feat(rag): Add FullContextRAG implementation

This commit adds a new RAG strategy, `FullContextRAG`, to the implementation library. This approach is based on the logic from the `atomic_pdf_qa_streamlit` tool.

The `FullContextRAG` class implements the `BaseRAG` interface and follows a "full context stuffing" methodology:
1.  During `ingest`, it loads the entire text of a document.
2.  It stuffs this full text into a large system prompt.
3.  During `query`, it sends the user's question along with the entire document context and chat history to the LLM, relying on the model's large context window to find the answer without an explicit retrieval step.

This new class is automatically available in the generic Streamlit UI and the evaluation harness, showcasing the extensibility of the new modular framework.
