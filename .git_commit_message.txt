fix(harness): Correct invalid import path for retriever

This commit fixes an `ImportError` in the RAG evaluation harness. The error was caused by an invalid character (`-`) in the import path for the `langchain_pdf_retriever`.

The directory `nlp/tools/langchain-file-processor` has been renamed to `nlp/tools/langchain_file_processor` to make it a valid Python package.

The corresponding import statement in `rag-eval-harness/retrievers/langchain_pdf_retriever.py` has been updated to use the new, correct path with an underscore. This resolves the module resolution error.
