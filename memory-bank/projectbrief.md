# Project Brief

## Purpose
A personal laboratory for rapid experimentation with AI, focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and supporting technologies. The goal is to build a collection of independent, runnable tools and minimal use cases for future development and reference.

## Scope
- Each tool is self-contained and runnable (preferably via Streamlit)
- Organized by theme (NLP, GenAI, Tech Enhancements)
- Designed for easy extension and reuse
- Not intended for production, but for learning, prototyping, and inspiration

## Goals
- Quickly prototype and test AI ideas
- Build a reusable library of minimal, runnable AI tools
- Document experiments and learnings for future reference
